## License

Tsacdop is licensed under the [GPL v3.0](https://github.com/stonega/tsacdop/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

## Build

1. If you don't have Flutter SDK installed; Please visit the official [Flutter][Flutter Install] site.
2. Fetch the latest source code from the master branch.

``` 
git clone https://github.com/stonega/tsacdop.git
```

3. Add api search api configure file.  

Tsacdop uses the ListenNotes API 1.0 pro to search for podcasts, which is not free, so I can not expose the API key in the repo.
If you want to build the app, you need to create a new file named `.env.dart` in the lib folder. Add the following code to `.env.dart`. If you don't have a ListenNotes api key, keep the apiKey empty like ''. Then the app will only support the PodcastIndex search.
You can get your own ListenNotes API key on [ListenNotes](https://www.listennotes.com/api/). Remember that you need to get a pro plan API because the basic plan doesn't provide an rss link for the search result. 

``` dart
final environment = {"apiKey":""};
```

4. Run the app with Android Studio or Visual Studio. Or the command line.

``` 
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
